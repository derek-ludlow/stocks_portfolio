# Overview
This is intended to be a simple stock portfolio application to help users keep track of and store the history and performance of their investment portfolio. I would say more importantly, this was a project I undertook in order to try and improve my skills and experience designing and building a functioning full-stack web application. It is absolutely a work in progress and needs alot of work still, but I will continue to work on it and provide some updates here. All part of the learning process!:)

# Development Environment

I used VScode to write this application, and wrote code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
Here is a list of some libraries and technologies used in this project so far with some information about each of them:

### React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
It's used on the frontend to create reusable UI components, manage component state, and handle rendering.
React's component-based architecture promotes code reusability and maintainability.

### Express.js
Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building web applications and APIs.
In our backend, Express.js handles routing, middleware integration, and HTTP request/response handling.

### React Router
React Router is a library for adding routing functionality to React applications.
It enables navigation between different views/components in a single-page application without full-page reloads.

### Body-parser
Body-parser is a middleware for handling JSON and URL-encoded data in Express.js.
It's used to parse incoming request bodies, making data available in req.body for easier processing.

### Path
Path is a core Node.js module used for handling file paths and directories.
In our application, we use the path module to construct file paths for serving static assets and rendering HTML files.

# Future Work
### Ensure Functionality
Verify that the server is correctly configured and operational, with API endpoints functioning as intended.
Confirm seamless communication between client-side components (React) and server-side endpoints.
Resolve any errors encountered during the application startup process to ensure smooth operation.

### Database Integration
Establish a stable connection to the database, ensuring that the server can interact with it effectively.
If using MongoDB or a similar database, validate the database URI and configuration settings.
Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to interact with the database and manage stock data effectively.

### Testing and Deployment
Conduct comprehensive testing of the application's functionality to identify and address any bugs or inconsistencies.
Validate each feature and component to ensure they perform reliably under different scenarios.
Prepare the application for deployment to a production environment, following best practices for security and scalability.
